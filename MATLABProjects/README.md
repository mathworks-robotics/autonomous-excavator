This example models an excavator with hydraulic actuation of the swing motor and 
cylinders for the boom, stick and bucket.  A MATLAB App enables you to explore 
the mechanical and hydraulic design space to calculate digging and lifting forces 
according to international standards.

* **Pin locations** can be adjusted in Excel or in the app. 
* **Digging forces (BOF/TOF)** are calculated according to ISO 6015:2016.
* **Pin loads** are calculated for BOF, TOF, and lift capacity tests.
* **Load charts** are determined at a range of arm positions.
* **Relief pressure thresholds** can be analyzed for each function and the pumps.
* **Hydraulic regeneration valves** are modeled to evaluate efficiency.
* **Dig cycle time and efficiency** are determined in dynamic simulation.
* **Realistic soil loads** are applied to the bucket using Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) software.
